            In the past, running a server was only possible for highly technical people or those who could afford to hire them;
            namely software developers, corporations, wealthy individuals, and politicians. Start9 levels the playing field by
            making it possible for the rest of us.

            EmbassyOS (EOS) is a browser-based, graphical operating system for a personal server, designed to turn anyone into a
            systemâ€™s administrator capable of managing their own server.
